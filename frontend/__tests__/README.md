# Frontend Test Directory

All Vitest and Testing Library tests for the frontend are now located in this directory. Test files
have been moved from their feature folders for easier discovery and maintenance.

- Place all new test files for React components here.
- Use relative imports to reference components (e.g., `import App from '../App'`).
- This directory is ignored by the production build.
